### What is dependency injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that promotes good software engineering practices. Here are some reasons why it's beneficial:

1. **Decoupling**: DI helps to decouple code and make it more modular. This means that components are less aware of each other's implementation details and interact through well-defined interfaces.

2. **Ease of Testing**: With DI, it's easier to replace real implementations with mock objects for testing. This makes unit testing easier and promotes the development of testable code.

3. **Code Reusability**: DI promotes code reusability by allowing the same dependency to be used in different parts of the application.

4. **Flexibility**: DI allows you to change the dependencies of a class without changing the class itself. This is particularly useful when you need to change your implementation or configuration without affecting your existing code.

5. **Readability and Maintainability**: By explicitly providing dependencies, the code becomes more self-explanatory and easier to maintain.

6. **Control over Object Creation**: DI frameworks often provide control over the lifecycle and scope of objects (singleton, prototype, etc.).

### DI in Java and Scala

In Java and Scala, there are several popular Dependency Injection (DI) frameworks:

**Java:**

1. **Spring Framework**: Spring is one of the most popular DI frameworks in Java. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications.

2. **Google Guice**: Guice is a lightweight but powerful framework developed by Google. It's less comprehensive than Spring, focusing mainly on DI.

3. **CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)**: CDI is a standard DI framework for Java EE. It's integrated with other Java EE technologies like JSF and EJB.

**Scala:**

1. **MacWire**: MacWire is a lightweight DI framework for Scala. It uses Scala's macro feature to generate wiring code at compile time.

2. **Scaldi**: Scaldi is another lightweight DI framework for Scala. It's designed to be easy to use and type-safe.

3. **Google Guice**: While Guice is a Java framework, it can also be used in Scala projects.

4. **Spring Framework**: Similarly, Spring can also be used in Scala projects, although it's less common due to the availability of Scala-specific frameworks.

### Compile-time vs runtime DI

Dependency Injection (DI) can be done at either compile-time or runtime. Here's a comparison of the two:

**Compile-Time Dependency Injection:**

1. **Safety**: Compile-time DI can catch errors at compile-time. If a required dependency is missing, the code will not compile.

2. **Performance**: Since dependencies are resolved at compile-time, there's no runtime overhead, which can lead to better performance.

3. **Tooling**: Compile-time DI can provide better tooling support, such as auto-completion and refactoring, because the dependencies are known at compile-time.

4. **Examples**: Dagger and MacWire are examples of frameworks that support compile-time DI.

**Runtime Dependency Injection:**

1. **Flexibility**: Runtime DI is more flexible because dependencies can be changed at runtime. This is useful in scenarios where the dependencies are not known until runtime.

2. **Complexity**: Runtime DI can handle more complex scenarios, such as circular dependencies, because it has a complete view of all dependencies at runtime.

3. **Ease of Use**: Runtime DI frameworks often provide more features and are easier to use because they handle a lot of the DI logic for you.

4. **Examples**: Spring and Guice are examples of frameworks that support runtime DI.

### Constructor vs setter

Constructor injection has several advantages over setter injection:

1. **Immutable Dependencies**: With constructor injection, dependencies can be declared as final, ensuring they are not modified after being set. This is not possible with setter injection, as the setters allow dependencies to be changed at any time.

2. **Explicit Dependencies**: Constructor injection makes it clear what dependencies a class has, as they must be provided when the class is instantiated. With setter injection, it's not immediately clear what dependencies a class has, as they can be set at any time.

3. **Fail-Fast**: If a dependency cannot be injected, with constructor injection, the application will fail to start. This is a good thing because it exposes the problem immediately. With setter injection, the failure will not occur until the setter is called, which could be much later.

4. **Easier Testing**: Constructor injection makes it easier to write unit tests, as you can simply provide the dependencies as constructor arguments. With setter injection, you have to call the setters in your tests, which can lead to more boilerplate code.

5. **Thread Safety**: Constructor injection is thread-safe because the object is fully initialized when it is constructed. With setter injection, there is a risk that a thread might see the object in an inconsistent state if it accesses it before all the setters have been called.

In conclusion, constructor injection is generally considered a better practice than setter injection due to its advantages in terms of immutability, explicitness, fail-fast behavior, ease of testing, and thread safety.


### What are effects and why do we need them?
In the context of functional programming, an effect refers to an operation that does something other than simply compute a result. This could be reading from or writing to a database, making a network request, reading from or writing to the console, or any other kind of interaction with the outside world. 

In pure functional programming, functions should not have side effects. They should only compute and return a value based on their input. However, most useful programs need to interact with the outside world in some way. To reconcile this, functional programming languages often model effects as values that can be computed, rather than operations that are performed. 

### Futures, Cats Effect IO, ZIO
Scala `Future`, Cats `IO`, and ZIO `ZIO` are all used to represent computations that may have side effects, but they have different features and design philosophies.

**Scala Future:**

- Futures in Scala are eager, meaning they start executing as soon as they are defined. This can make them harder to reason about because side effects can occur at unexpected times. Given that the execution of a Future is not separate to its creation, Future is not a real effect.  
- Futures are not referentially transparent, which is a key property in functional programming.
- Error handling with Futures can be tricky because a failed Future might throw an exception immediately upon creation.
- Futures lack some powerful combinators for dealing with concurrency and resource management.

**Cats IO:**

- Cats `IO` is a data type for encoding side effects as pure values, addressing some of the issues with `Future`.
- `IO` is lazy, meaning computations are not executed until the "end of the world", i.e., the main function or the point where the side effect needs to be executed.
- `IO` has a rich set of combinators for transforming and composing instances.
- `IO` provides better support for error handling than `Future`.
- `IO` Cats Effects library has support for cancellation and concurrent programming. 

**ZIO:**

- `ZIO` data type includes an error type parameter, which allows for type-safe error handling. This can help prevent runtime errors and make your code more robust.
- `ZIO` includes an environment type parameter, which can be used to provide dependencies to your effects. This can make your code more modular and testable.
- `ZIO` has first-class support for concurrency and parallelism, with a number of powerful combinators for managing concurrent and parallel computations.

In summary, while `Future` is built into Scala, it has several limitations. Both Cats `IO` and ZIO provide more powerful and flexible ways to deal with effects. `ZIO` is more robust and provides type-safe error handling and environment type parameter which can be used to provide dependencies.


## Core ZIO Data Types

ZIO provides several core data types to represent different kinds of effects:

1. **ZIO[R, E, A]**: This is the main data type in ZIO. It represents an effectful program that requires an environment of type `R`, may fail with an error of type `E`, or may succeed with a value of type `A`.

2. **UIO[A]**: This is a type alias for `ZIO[Any, Nothing, A]`. It represents an effect that cannot fail and does not require any environment.

3. **URIO[R, A]**: This is a type alias for `ZIO[R, Nothing, A]`. It represents an effect that cannot fail and requires an environment of type `R`.

4. **Task[A]**: This is a type alias for `ZIO[Any, Throwable, A]`. It represents an effect that may fail with a `Throwable` and does not require any environment.

5. **RIO[R, A]**: This is a type alias for `ZIO[R, Throwable, A]`. It represents an effect that may fail with a `Throwable` and requires an environment of type `R`.

6. **IO[E, A]**: This is a type alias for `ZIO[Any, E, A]`. It represents an effect that may fail with an error of type `E` and does not require any environment.

7. **ZIOApp**: This is an entry point for ZIO applications. It provides a default runtime and requires you to implement a `run` method that produces a `ZIO` effect.

8. **Runtime[R]**: This is capable of executing tasks within an environment `R`.

9. **Exit[E, A]**: This describes the result of executing an IO value. It can be either a success (`Exit.Success`) with a value of type `A`, or a failure (`Exit.Failure`) with a cause of type `E`.

### Elements of Service pattern

1. Service definition with scala trait
2. Classes for service implementation; dependencies passed via constructors (interfaces, not implementation)
3. ZLayer constructors
4. Accessor methods to create more ergonomic API (could be autogenerated with available macros)
